# Feature Matching with FLANN
<i>FLANN</i> stands for <b>Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors</b>. It contains a collection of algorithms optimized for fast nearest neighbor search in large datasets and for high dimensional features. It works faster than BFMatcher for large datasets
<br>
<br>

### Flann matching algorithm can be used in <b>OpenCV</b> as follows :
```sh 
    cv2.FlannBasedMatcher()
```

</br>


## Output:
