# Watershed Algorithm with Custom Seeds

## What is Watershed algorithm ?
The watershed is a classical algorithm used for segmentation, that is, for separating different objects in an image. Starting from user-defined markers, the watershed algorithm treats pixels values as a local topography (elevation).

## What is Watershed algorithm with Custom Seeds?
The watershed algorithm of image segmentation is used when we have initial segmented points and want to automatically fill surrounding areas with the same segmentation class. These initial segmented points are called seeds, and they should be set manually, but in some cases, it's possible to automatically assign them. This recipe shows how to implement the watershed segmentation algorithm in OpenCV.

## Steps to use this notebook of Watershed Algorithm:
1. Run the notebook.
2. Press 1-9 to set color of the marker.
3. Click on the image with selected marker will set find the contours automatically.
4. To clear press C.
5. To quit press ESC.
