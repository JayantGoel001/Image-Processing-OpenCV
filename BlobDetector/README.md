# BLOB DETECTION USING OPENCV

## What is a Blob?
A Blob is a group of connected pixels in an image that share some common property ( E.g grayscale value ).

</br>

## Blob Detection
- Read Image using OpenCV imread() function.
- Create or Set up the Simple Blob Detector.
- Input image in the created detector.
- Obtain key points on the image.
- Draw shapes on the Key points found on the image

</br>

### Blobdetection algorithm can be used in <b>OpenCV</b> as follows :
```sh 
    cv2.SimpleBlobDetector()
```


</br>

## Output:

### Input image is:
