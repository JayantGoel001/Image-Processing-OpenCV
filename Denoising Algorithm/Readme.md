## Denoising Algorithm
In this script we implemented **Denoising Algorithm** of `Open CV` by using `Python` which is used to remove the noise from the image.

We have different variation for this technique
- `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising()` - works with a single grayscale images
- `cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored()` - works with a color image.

## Setup instructions

#### You can use this in two ways
* For these you need to install **OpenCV** in your machine.
* Than you can go for *file*
