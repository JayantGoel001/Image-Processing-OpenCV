# Working of Dilation

1. A kernel(a matrix of odd size(3,5,7) is convolved with the image.Here,matrix of size=5 is used.

2. A pixel element in the original image is ‘1’ if atleast one pixel under the kernel is ‘1’.

3. Thus,Dilation increases the white region in the image or size of foreground object increases.
