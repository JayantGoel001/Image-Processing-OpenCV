## **IMAGE MASKING**

Image Masking is a powerful technique in OpenCV and Image Processing. Mask allows us to focus on the portions of the image that interest us. Here in this notebook we have the image of a cartoon and we are interested in certain portion of the image only so we do image masking. Image masking is a useful when we are not concerned with the whole image and need specific part of the image only.
